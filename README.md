# Kotlin and Android Studion

In this project I have worked to learn android development studio, kotlin programming language. I found that I had more of a challenge with android studio than I did learning the Kotlin language. It was a good experience and I learned a lot. I want to further my learning so that I can become more efficient and building apps.

The software that I coded is a simple simon says memory game. It mimiks the simon handheld games made by hasbro. Upon starting the software you will see a menu screen that has one button to start the game. From there it will say simon says blue. You click on the blue button. Then it asks you for color 1, so you would click the blue button again. Next it might say to pick the red button. After you select the red button it will ask you for color one, so you would pick the blue button. Then it will ask you for color 2, so you would then pick the red button. It continues in this pattern picking a color at random for the next simon says until the user either gets the wrong answer or gets five correct answers in a row.

My purpose in making this software was to learn the kotlin coding language and then to learn android studio. I choose to make this game because I have young children and my two youngest are learning colors. I figured that colors and patterns are good for children development. I would like to in the future put a timer on the pattern to up the difficulty, also I would like to make a second mode where the user trys to remember shapses rather than colors.

# Development Environment

The tools used in this project was mainly android studio. Android studio is a fairly straight forward IDE used to build android apps. It has a bit of a steep learning curve for certain parts, but for the designing of the app interface it used a simple language similar to css.

The Programming language that I used was kotlin. It is very similar to Java, but is more sleak and efficient. Google announced that Kotlin is the official language of android developers.
